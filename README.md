# Slab

## A PHP5 framework.

Slab is/was an MVC framework inspired by CakePHP and CodeIgniter, but I actually want to move away from the strict MVC paradigm and loosen it up.

The original Slab is currently in `old/`, and I'm starting basically from scratch.

Tasks are on the [Trello board][trello_board]
